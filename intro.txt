Frogger is a 1981 arcade game developed by Konami. This time we use java to let classic come back. You are a frog with only one life, so you need to be careful with every move you make. In the game, you press keys left, up, right, and down to control your frog. Try to get Frogger through the lanes of traffic. Traffic travels in alternative directions and at different speeds, so be careful! Frogger will get 'splooched' if he touches any part of a vehicle or is run over.Frogger can hop from side to side on a log.These tricky turtles can float on the water and dive under the water!
